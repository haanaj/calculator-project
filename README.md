I created this calculator through watching [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQEYAOPWDzk). To view other videos by @mmtuts, click [here](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzyuZJ8zZ-Lhfnz41DG5qLw).

It's a very basic calculator but the tutorial is intended to teach you how to code using basic JavaScript.

I found this tutorial on this [website](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/beginner-programming-projects/). This website has lots of great projects for coders who are just starting off.

While the tutorial goes through how to build a basic calculator, it didn't have any CSS. I added my own CSS to my calculator to make it look a little more nicer!

Thanks!
